### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

<br/>

I'm a (Flutter) Technical Lead / Senior Software Engineer for a Health Insurance provider in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the new Flutter cross-platform app I created, that allows access to my current company services.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: E2E Tests, App Security and UI/UX Design.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: How to start your Flutter studies.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: halextomasi@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: Started my studies with Xamarin in late 2018, but almost gave up trying to get an opportunity as a mobile developer, but in early 2021, I got a great opportunity to finally make my transition complete with Flutter.
